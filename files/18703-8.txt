INTRODUCTION.


It is thought best that I should give, in connection with the catalogue
of collections made by the party under my charge in 1880-'81, a brief
statement in relation to the collections described in the catalogues,
and the information obtained in regard to the Pueblo tribes.

Our explorations during the field season of 1880 and 1881 were
restricted to the Pueblo tribes located along the Rio Grande and its
tributaries in New Mexico. The chief object in view was to secure as
soon as possible all the ethnological and archaeological data obtainable
before it should be lost to science by the influx of civilized
population which is being rapidly thrown into this region by the
extension of railroads into and through it. Not only are the
architectural remains being rapidly destroyed and archaeological
specimens collected and carried away by travelers, excursionists, and
curiosity hunters, but the ancient habits and customs of these tribes
are rapidly giving way and falling into disuse before the influence of
eastern civilization.

Our party, consisting, besides myself, of Mr. Galbraith, archaeologist,
Mr. Morancy, assistant, and Mr. J. K. Hillers, photographer, proceeded
to Santa Fé, N. Mex., where an outfit was secured for the season's work.
From here we proceeded to Taos, one of the most extensive pueblos in the
Rio Grande region. This village is situated on the Rio Taos a few miles
from the Rio Grande, and just under the shadow of the Taos Mountains. It
comprises two large sections, one on each side of the Rio Taos. These
are compactly built and each six stories high. The industrial pursuits
of these Indians are principally pastoral and agricultural, they having
a good market for their products in the Mexican village of Fernandez de
Taos, containing a population of about 4,000 Mexicans and eastern
people.

The party spent several days here making investigations and collections.
The collection made was small but quite varied and novel, though few of
the articles obtained were of their own manufacture.

Quite a number of stone implements were secured, among which were some
stone knives, pipes, a number of rude stone axes and hammers, arrow
smoothers, &c. The pottery obtained here is chiefly of the common type
and resembles that from San Juan, from whence in all probability it was
received by exchange and barter. Earthenware, so far as I can learn, is
not now made in Taos, except by a few families where a Taos Indian has
married a woman from San Juan or some other tribe where the manufacture
of pottery is carried on. If this industry was ever, practiced by the
Taos Indians it must have been at a remote period; in fact there seems
to be no tradition of it now among them.

From here we went next to the pueblo of San Juan, situated on the left
bank of the Rio Grande, about 50 miles south of Taos. At this pueblo a
collection was made of stone implements, articles of clay, &c. These
specimens are not quite so representative as those from some of the
more southern pueblos, the village being situated on one of the military
wagon roads, over which many Europeans pass, and hence frequently
visited; many of the most valuable specimens of implements and pottery
have been bartered away; however, those we obtained display quite
fully all the industries of the people of this pueblo. This collection
consists of a number of fine stone mortars, pestles, arrow and spear
heads, also several polishing stones. Quite a number of small animal
forms carved out of stone were also secured. At this pueblo many
specimens of the black polished ware peculiar to a few of the tribes
in the Rio Grande Valley were collected.

From San Juan we proceeded to Santa Clara, situated a few miles below
on the right bank of the Rio Grande. This pueblo proved to be so
interesting in its surroundings that some time was spent here in
making investigations. We found the people extensively engaged in the
manufacture of that black polished pottery of which so little has been
known heretofore, especially in regard to the process of baking and
coloring it, which is fully described in the text accompanying the
catalogue of last year in this volume. The larger portion of the
specimens of earthenware obtained here was of this kind, though several
specimens of the red and some few of the ornamented class were also
secured.

Most of the pottery manufactured at this village is the black polished
ware. That of the decorated class is ornamented with the juice of
_Cleome integrifolia_, which is fixed in the ware in the process of
burning. Mineral substances, so far as I could learn, are not used by
the Indians of Santa Clara in decorating their pottery.

Among the specimens are a number of interesting stone implements, nearly
all of an older kind than any made by this people at the present day.

During our stay at this pueblo some interesting archaeological
discoveries were made of which a brief mention in this connection may
not be out of place, and which will certainly prove of great interest
to future investigators. Between the Rio Grande and Valle Mountains,
commencing about 12 miles below, or south, of Santa Clara, and extending
south, to within ten miles of Cochití, a distance of about 65 miles,
is an extensive area, the intermediate elevated portion of which
is composed of a yellowish volcanic tufa, of coarse texture and
sufficiently soft and yielding to be readily worked or carved with rude
stone implements. Over this entire area there are irregular elevations,
somewhat circular in outline, from 50 to 200 feet in height, the faces
of which have been worn away by the elements, and are in nearly all
instances perpendicular. These consecutive elevations extend back from
the Rio Grande from five to fifteen miles. Over this whole expanse of
country, in the faces of these cliffs, we found an immense number of
cavate dwellings, cut out by the hand of man. We made no attempt to
count the number of these curious dwellings, dug like hermit cells out
of the rock, but they may be estimated with safety among the thousands.
I made many inquiries of the neighboring tribes in regard to the history
of these dwellings, but could elicit no information from any of them.
The response was invariably, "they are very old and the people who
occupied them are gone."

An inspection of a portion of this area revealed a condition of things
which I have no doubt prevails throughout. The dwellings were found in
the faces of the cliffs, about 20 feet apart in many instances, but the
distances are irregular. A careful examination satisfied me that they
were excavated with rude stone implements resembling adzes, numbers of
which were found here, and which were probably used by fastening one end
to a handle.

The doorways, which are square, were first cut into the face of the wall
to a depth of about one foot, and then the work of enlarging the room
began. The interiors of the rooms are oval in shape, about 12 feet in
diameter, and only of sufficient height to enable one to stand upright.

The process, from the evidences shown inside, of carving out the
interior of the dwelling was by scraping grooves several inches deep and
apart, and breaking out the intermediate portion; in this way the work
progressed until the room reached the desired size. Inside of these
rooms were found many little niches and excavated recesses used for
storing household ornaments, the larger ones probably supplying the
place of cupboards. Near the roofs of many of the caves are mortises,
projecting from which, in many instances, were found the decayed ends of
wooden beams or sleepers, which were probably used, as they are now in
the modern Pueblo dwellings, as poles over which to hang blankets and
clothing, or to dry meat. These dwellings were without fireplaces; but
the evidences of fire were plainly visible at the side of each cave,
and in none of those visited did we find any orifice for the egress of
the smoke but the small doorway. On the outside or in front of these
singular habitations are rows of holes mortised into the face of the
cliffs about the doors. It is quite evident that these were for the
insertion of beams of wood (for forming booths or shelters in the
front), as ends of beams were found sticking there, which, in their
sheltered position and in this dry climate, may have been preserved for
centuries.

Upon the top of the mesa of which these cliffs are the exposed sides we
found the ruins of large circular buildings made of square stones 8 by
12 inches in size. The walls of some of these structures remain standing
to the height of ten or twelve feet, and show that from four to five
hundred people can find room within each inclosure. One of these
buildings was rectangular and two were round structures. The latter were
about 100 and 150 feet in diameter, the rectangular one about 300 feet
square. Many small square rooms were constructed in the interior from
large cut bricks of the tufa of which the bluffs are composed. These
rooms all opened toward the center of the large inclosure, which has
but one general doorway. From these ruins we secured great quantities
of pottery, arrow and spear heads, knives, grinding-stones,
arrow-smoothers, and many of the small flint adzes, which were
undoubtedly used for making the blocks for the structures on the
mesa and for excavating the cave dwellings. Among the débris in the
dwellings are found corncobs and other evidences of the food used by the
inhabitants. This certainly indicates that the people who occupied these
singular dwellings were agricultural.

The faces of some of the more prominent cliffs contained as many as
three rows of chambers one above the other; the débris at the foot,
sometimes 200 feet deep, covered up at least two rows of these chambers.

Along the edges of the cliffs and over the rocky surface of the mesa
are winding footpaths from 3 to 10 inches deep, worn by the feet of the
inhabitants. Some of these paths showed perceptible foot-prints where it
was inconvenient for those following the path to do otherwise than tread
in the footsteps of their predecessors.

In our limited investigations we were unable to discover any evidence of
burial customs. No graves could be found, and nothing of human remains.

The southern portion of this area seems to have been most densely
populated. Some of the protected walls in the neighborhood retain
hieroglyphics in abundance. These resemble the picture writing of the
present Indians of that region. Many interesting specimens of the art of
this ancient people can be seen in the images of wild animals scattered
over various spots. Many of them are cut in full relief out of the tufa
and are always in some natural attitude, and can always be identified
where the weather has not destroyed the original form. The most
prominent are two mountain lions, side by side and life size.

Further examinations will reveal much more of value and interest in
connection with this very inviting locality.

Mr. Galbraith, who accompanied my party, spent some time examining this
region and made collections here.

The next pueblo visited was San Ildefonso, about five miles below Santa
Clara, on the opposite bank of the Rio Grande. But few specimens were
obtained here. The people of this pueblo devote their time chiefly
to agricultural and pastoral pursuits, and have almost abandoned the
manufacture of pottery, that in use by them at the present time being
mostly obtained from neighboring tribes.

From San Ildefonso we proceeded to Nambé, a pueblo which has become
almost extinct. The remnant of this people is situated about 25 miles
above Ildefonso, on Nambé Creek, and not far from the base of the
mountains. The people of Nambé have several times in years past moved
their pueblo higher up the stream, the valley of which furnishes them
fine agricultural and grazing grounds. They make very little pottery,
but we found stored in many of the houses of the village great
quantities of stone implements, principally large metates and
grinding-stones. We also found many specimens of interest among the
ruins of old Nambé and Pojuaque, as well as the remains of pottery in
such quantities as to show that in the past the manufacture of pottery
had been carried on quite extensively. In this vicinity I made
arrangements with one of the employés of the party, who had resided
many years at Santa Fé, to make excavations and collections from the
old sites of Nambé, Pojuaque, and Cuyamunque, in which he was quite
successful.

From the pueblos north of Santa Fé we traveled direct to Cochití,
27 miles southwest of Santa Fé. This village is situated on the right
bank of the Rio Grande and about three miles from Peña Blanca, a small
Mexican town opposite. Here a very interesting collection was secured
consisting mostly of pottery, many of the vessels simulating animal
forms, variously ornamented with representations of some varieties of
the flora of the locality. A few stone implements were also obtained
here.

We next visited Jémez, situated on the Rio Jémez. From thence we went
to Silla and Santa Ana. At each of these villages representative
collections were made, all of which are referred to in detail in the
catalogue.

The next villages visited were Santo Domingo and Sandia, on the Rio
Grande. Some characteristic specimens were obtained at each of these
pueblos. The method of their manufacture and the manner of using them
are generally the same as in most of the other pueblos.

A small collection of rude stone hammers was obtained from the turquois
mine in the Cerrillo Mountains, about 25 miles from Santa Fé.

The products of this celebrated mine, which were objects of traffic
all over New Mexico, as well as contiguous countries, probably formed
one inducement which led to the Spanish conquest of this region. The
turquoises from this mine have always been valued as ornaments by the
Indians of New Mexico, and carried far and wide for sale by them.
The mine was worked in a most primitive manner with these rude stone
hammers, a number of which were secured. The collections are all now
in the National Museum for study and inspection.

The following sketch is introduced here to show the method of using the
batten stick represented in Fig. 546. There is not a family among the
Pueblos or Navajos that does not possess the necessary implements for
weaving blankets, belts and garters. Figs. 500-502 will convey an idea
of the variety in design and coloring which prevails in this class of
Indian fabrics, while Fig. 710 represents a blanket weaver at work. The
picture is taken from a photograph made on the spot by Mr. Hillers, and
is colored in accordance with the actual colors of the yarns and threads
used in its manufacture.

The particular class of blankets represented in this illustration is
woven in the estufas, and is used almost exclusively in sacred dances
and ceremonies of the tribe, all other garments being made in the houses
or in the open air. The Navajos are celebrated for their skill as
blanket weavers, and the Mokis are equally skilled in the manufacture
of a finer class of the same article, which is much sought after by the
surrounding tribes for ornamental purposes in sacred and other dances.

The vertical threads, as shown in the figure, are the warp threads; the
coarser thread which is inserted transversely between these is the yarn
or weft. The three rods in the center of the blanket are lease rods,
which are introduced among the threads of the warp to separate them and
thus facilitate the insertion of the weft thread. These rods are each
passed in front of one warp thread and behind another, alternately,
across the whole warp, and between each rod the threads are brought from
the back of one to the front of the next, and _vice versa_. The bar held
in hands of the weaver serves as a batten for driving or beating the
weft thread into the angle formed by the crossed warp threads.

This loom resembles in principle the ancient Egyptian, Grecian, and
French looms which are described on pages 55 to 62 of "The History and
Principles of Weaving by Hand and Power," by A. Barlow, London, 1878,
and on pages 41 to 45 of the "Treatise on Weaving and Designing of
Textile Fabrics," by Thomas E. Ashenhurst, Bradford, England, 1881.

Britain," by A. Ure, London, 1861.

ARTICLES OF CLAY.

These consist of vessels of pottery, a few clay images, and two or
three clay pipes. The pottery (with the exception of one or two pieces
obtained from other pueblos) is all black ware, some of which is quite
well polished. Some of the ollas are quite large, the form shown in fig.
699 (46993), predominating; others with rather high neck which is marked
with sharp, oblique ridges, as shown in fig. 700 (47023).

  [Illustration: Fig. 699. 46993]

_POLISHED BLACK WARE._

428, (46993). Olla shown in fig. 699. The somewhat peculiar form of the
  body, the sharp curve at the shoulder and straight line in the lower
  half, is the point to which attention is more particularly called, as
  this appears to be the principal type form of these vessels, with this
  pueblo.

_BLACK OR BROWN WARE._

(Blackened by use on the fire; not polished.)

This ware, when first made and before use, varies in shade from dark
earth color to reddish-brown, but the soot, smoke, and fire, when in
use, soon darken it; hence it is usually described as black ware. The
articles are used for cooking purposes, such as pots--which are usually
pot-shaped--some without handles and some with a handle on one side,
bowls, &c. The pots vary in capacity from a pint to a little over a
gallon.

_WHITENED WARE WITH COLORED DECORATIONS._

There are but few specimens of this ware, which are chiefly important

quality that characterizes the ancient pottery of that region. The
decorations and general appearance also ally it to the ancient ware.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
